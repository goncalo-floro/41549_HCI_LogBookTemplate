# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem

Changing bad habits is a major challenge for many people. Even with the intention to improve, the lack of motivation, discipline, and a proper support system causes many to give up before reaching their goals. The problem we aim to solve is the difficulty people face in abandoning harmful habits and consistently adopting new positive behaviors.

# Context
[What is the context for your work. What area of application. It can be travelling, pet treatment, shopping. State the overall context and why it is interesting to think about it.]

Our project is set in the context of personal development and well-being. Many individuals seek to change aspects of their lives, whether by adopting a healthier routine, reducing excessive technology use, improving productivity, or quitting addictions. However, habit change is a complex process that involves psychological, social, and motivational factors. Developing a technological solution that facilitates this transition can have a significant impact on people's quality of life.

# Challenges
[What are aspects that remain a challenge? What is difficult to do? What could profit from a more customizable approach?]

Some of the main challenges in habit change include:
- Lack of motivation: Many people start with enthusiasm but quickly lose interest;
- Difficulty in maintaining consistency: Forming a new habit requires repetition over time, which can be challenging without proper reinforcement;
- Influence of environment and society: External factors, such as unsupportive friends or family, can slow down progress or even reverse it.
- Lack of personalization: Each person has a unique journey, and generic solutions may not be effective for everyone.
- Absence of an efficient reward system: The human brain responds well to rewards, and the lack of them can make adopting new behaviors difficult.

# The goal
[In a short sentence state what is the problem you wish to address]

Our main goal is to develop an interactive solution that motivates and helps people overcome harmful habits, encouraging the sustainable and personalized development of new healthy routines.
