# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Maria goes on a Museum Tour

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelmingâ€”so many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen. The system, aware of her general interests in **digital media and abstract art**, suggested a self-guided tour tailored to her preferences.  ]

[Curious, Maria followed the suggested path. As she approached the first painting, the guide vibrated slightlyâ€”a prompt that additional content was available. Holding up the guide, she saw an **overlay** appear on the screen, revealing a time-lapse animation of the artist creating the piece. A small **audio clip** played, explaining the artistâ€™s thought process and influences. Maria found this fascinating; it was as if the artwork was coming to life in front of her.  ]

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing. The system, recognizing her engagement, suggested another exhibit nearby featuring similar themes. Midway through her visit, she received a pop-up asking if sheâ€™d like a **short quiz** on the artworks she had explored, offering an interactive way to reflect on what she had learned.  ]
