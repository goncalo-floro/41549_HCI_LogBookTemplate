# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Alberto Fernandes wants to check how his friend is doing

Alberto is always worried about his friend, so he often textes him about his addictions, but when he does it, he thinks that he his putting too much pressure on his friend, so after seeing his **friends status**, he is a lot more relieved about his friend.

Sometimes he is occupied working and forgets to check on his friend, but he recieves a **warning notification** if somethings wrong with his friend happends. This happends if his friend got a relapse, or if he had a bad day.

---

## Scenario 2: JÃ©ssica Orlando had a relapse and whants some motivation

JÃ©ssica had a tough day and gave in to drinking too much coffee again. She opens the app and looks for motivational **posts** shared by other users who have faced similar challenges. She also receives positive reinforcement messages from the groups she follows, which helps her feel supported.

She also changed her **status** to a sad face so that her friends know that she needs motivation and support on this day. As a result, they receive a notification about her status and can reach out to her.

Because of her relapse, JÃ©ssica also marks the day on her **calendar** to keep track of it. She doesnâ€™t want constant reminders of her addiction, so the app only shows her how many days or hours she has stayed strong since her last relapse.

---

## Scenario 3: Sofia Almeida whant to see if her clients need her

Sofia goes to her page, and marks her **status** as available. This way, her clients can text her at any hour, and she can see if they need an apointment with her or if they just need a little motivation.

To **mark appointments**, Sofia goes to her calendar and marks the day and time she has available time for her clients. Like this, her clients can see the best times to make an appointment with her.

In her free time, Sofia also likes to **post** some motivation lines about quitting addictions. She can post it in the general feed, and if she wants, she can also post it with a specific tag, because the **app prioritizes posts by tag adequation**.
