## Background

Alberto has been friends with Arthur since their high school days, where they both studied science and technology. Though their paths diverged after graduation, they remained close friends. While Alberto built a stable life, working and maintaining a steady routine, Arthur fell into the world of gambling addiction. Seeing his friend struggle has deeply affected Alberto, motivating him to be a constant source of support despite the challenges.

## Daily Life
 
Alberto wakes up early every morning and heads to his job at a local supermarket, working long shifts that often extend into the evening. In his limited free time, he uses his smartphone to stay connected with friends and manage his personal life. Technology plays a key role in how he checks in on Arthur, though balancing his job and personal commitments often makes this difficult. One of his main concerns is ensuring Arthur stays on track, even when Alberto can’t be there in person.

## Goals & Needs

Alberto's primary goal is to help Arthur overcome his gambling addiction. He is actively looking for effective ways to support his friend, understand his behavior patterns, and encourage positive change. Alberto hopes to find tools that allow him to monitor Arthur's progress and offer timely support, even when life gets busy.

## Pain Points & Challenges

One of Alberto's biggest challenges is finding enough time to support Arthur while managing his own demanding work schedule. His job as a supermarket stock clerk requires long hours and physical effort, leaving him with limited energy at the end of the day. This makes it difficult for him to be present whenever Arthur might be struggling. Additionally, Alberto often feels frustrated by the lack of real-time information about his friend's emotional state or potential relapses. Not knowing whether Arthur is in crisis creates a constant sense of worry and helplessness, as Alberto fears missing the moments when his support could make the greatest difference.

## Motivation

Alberto engages with the product to stay connected and provide consistent support to Arthur's recovery journey. It helps him monitor his friend's progress and step in when needed, despite his limited time and availability.
