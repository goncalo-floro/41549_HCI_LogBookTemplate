**Name:** Jéssica Orlando  
**Age:** 47  
**Occupation:** Caffeine Addiction
**Location:** Lisboa, Portugal  

## Background

Jéssica Orlando is a single mother of two young children, aged 7 and 12. She works as an accountant in an office from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM, managing her career and raising her kids on her own. This means she is responsible for taking them to school, picking them up, and attending their activities, leaving her with very little time for rest or to take care of household tasks. As a result, Jéssica has developed a heavy reliance on caffeine to stay awake during long working hours and get through her daily chores. Over time, this dependency turned into a caffeine addiction, prompting her to seek help for it.

## Daily Life

Jéssica’s days are filled with constant juggling. She wakes up early to get her kids ready for school and manages a busy work schedule until evening. After work, she picks up her kids, takes them to extracurricular activities, and prepares dinner. The little free time she has is often consumed by household tasks. Jéssica’s use of caffeine, particularly coffee and energy drinks, is a constant throughout her day to keep up with the demands of both work and motherhood. With the recent changes in her life, including finding a partner, she is starting to find more time to rest, but her caffeine habit still affects her daily routine. 

## Goals & Needs

Jéssica’s primary goal is to break free from her caffeine addiction. She wants to regain control of her energy levels and reduce her reliance on stimulants to get through her day. With more support at home, she aims to find healthier ways to manage her energy and focus, and she hopes to regain a better work-life balance without the constant pressure of needing caffeine to function. 

## Pain Points & Challenges

Jéssica’s biggest challenge is managing her energy without relying on caffeine. As a single mother with a demanding job, her daily routine leaves little space for self-care or relaxation. This dependency on caffeine not only affects her physical health but also prevents her from achieving the rest and mental clarity she needs. Despite her desire to change, the constant demands of motherhood and work make it difficult for her to prioritize breaking the habit.

## Motivation

Jéssica is motivated by the desire to regain control over her life and health. With her partner’s support, she now has more time to focus on herself and tackle her caffeine addiction. She wants to feel more energized naturally, without the need for stimulants, and live a healthier, more balanced life for herself and her children.
