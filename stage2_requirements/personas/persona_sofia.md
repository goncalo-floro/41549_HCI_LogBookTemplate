**Name:** Sofia Almeida 
**Age:** 38 
**Occupation:** Psychologist  
**Location:** Porto, Portugal  

## Background

Dra. Sofia Almeida has worked for over 12 years in the field of addiction recovery. She currently balances her time between a rehabilitation clinic and her private practice, where she treats patients dealing with various forms of dependency, including substance abuse and technology-related addictions. Throughout her career, she has helped hundreds of patients overcome their addictions and rebuild their lives. Sofia is deeply committed to her work and continuously seeks new ways to provide better support for her patients, both inside and outside of clinical settings.

## Daily Life

Sofia's days are typically packed with therapy sessions, consultations, and administrative tasks. She spends her mornings at the rehabilitation clinic in Porto, leading group therapy sessions and overseeing treatment plans. In the afternoons, she attends to private patients in her consulting office. Despite her busy schedule, Sofia dedicates time to staying updated on new therapeutic tools and technologies. She uses her laptop and smartphone frequently to manage appointments, take notes, and follow up with patients between sessions. One of her growing concerns is how to provide continuous care and prevent relapses, especially when patients are outside the controlled environment of therapy. 

## Goals & Needs

Sofia aims to offer a more proactive and continuous support system for her patients. She is looking for tools that allow her to monitor clients remotely, detect early signs of relapse, and intervene before intensive clinical treatment becomes necessary. Her ultimate goal is to foster a supportive virtual environment that encourages patients to seek help at the right time, maintaining their progress toward recovery. 

## Pain Points & Challenges

One of Sofia's main challenges is the lack of real-time visibility into her patients' mental and emotional states once they leave her office or the clinic. She often worries about patients isolating themselves or hiding their struggles until it's too late for early intervention. Additionally, managing the follow-up process for multiple patients can be overwhelming, especially when relying solely on traditional methods like phone calls and in-person check-ins. Sofia needs a more efficient and scalable way to stay connected and informed about her patients' wellbeing without increasing her already heavy workload.

## Motivation

Sofia engages with the product to enhance her ability to monitor and support her patients remotely. She sees technology as a key ally in providing timely interventions and creating a virtual safety net that encourages patients to seek help before a relapse escalates. Her motivation is to ensure that every patient receives the support they need, when they need it.
