**What concerns or hesitations do they have about the new help system?** 
- Idea seems too idealistic because to get professionals on board with the app they would need to be compensated and therefore a free help app would not be sustainable

- They believe the app could be successful if we collaborated with professionals as an extension of their work, where medical professionals use the app, and their employers cover the costs ,or if we integrated ads for monetization.
