Favorite Sobriety Clock App
Get the app, take my word. You can trust me today, that wasn't always that way but I am trustworthy today ðŸ˜Š I've had a couple of these apps over the years and this one is absolutely my favorite with all the different features and things to use it for besides the clock but the clock is why I originally got it. The other app i still have the clock doesn't work as good but has a lot of literature which I really do like having on my phone to use if I need on the go, still nothing like the books to flip through and hold but I use it as needed. So getting back to this app I'd love if there was some of the literature from different fellowships added. But really love the work that has been put into this app and truly appreciate all your efforts to be of service to the recovery community at large whatever each persons specific "poison" is.

Great concept! Terrible performanceâ€¦
I love sobriety counters first and foremost. Itâ€™s a great concept to set a date and time and then track the hours and money you have saved in your sobriety from your vice(s). This app has a lot of great features for someone wanting a sense of accomplishment for their sobriety. However, the app performance is often like watching paint dry, at least for me.

I see a lot of great reviews for this app and my only thought is perhaps people are overlooking the awful performance because of the concept. I get that. But I mean a lot of the times when I open the app I get a blank screen. It can take 6 or so seconds to load the clock. Basically, everything feels extremely sluggish. I hope this is something the developers recognize. If they fix that up I would rate the app higher. I am tempted to find another app to track my sobriety but I will keep this one around for now, as it seems to be one of the more popular ones. With that said, if the performance isnâ€™t sped up at least a small amount, I will definitely be looking for another app.
