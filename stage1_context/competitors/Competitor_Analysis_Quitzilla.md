A great app for overcoming addictions. The calendar is easily visible, allowing you to track your progress effortlessly. Additionally, you can set goals and monitor your abstinence time. The "age clock" serves as a great reminder of how short life is and that we should make the most of it. There is also a statistics section and an achievements tab.

The app itself is good; it fulfills its purpose and accurately shows how long you have refrained from a certain habit. However, I believe it lacks two crucial aspects for an app with this goal: a better interface and more effective affirmations. These two aspects can and should be improved—the interface is too simple, and the motivational messages should appear more frequently and be genuinely useful (I say this because, for me, they weren’t).
