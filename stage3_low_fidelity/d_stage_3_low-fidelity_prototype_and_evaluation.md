## D.2. Prototype Evaluation

### Overall Tester information

We only tested our low-fidelity prototype during the week 8 class, there were 5 testers ( 4 were male and one was female) and they were all university students.
They all tested all the tasks and left various critiques and positive feedback.

### Reviews & Critiques
#### Sign up task

+ We are too ambiguous in the instructions we give to the user in:
	+ Money spent per week input
	+ Motivation input
	+ Times the addiction is practiced weekly input
+ Icons in the login page were not adequate
+ Login page components should be bigger

#### Addiction management task

+ There should be a title for the addiction tracker
+ Button to delete an addiction needs to be more visible
+ The *add addiction* button was not intuitive and required tweaking

#### Chatting task

+ The *create group* and *add friends* icons need to be more specific
+ *Create group* workflow is not intuitive
+ Font-size too small
+ The colors for group chat distinction is a good measure
+ In the *plus icon* to create a new *dm*, there should be an option to create a group

#### Community interaction task

+ Maybe the community description could have an option to be hidden
+ Very intuitive layout
+ There should be a tracker for the time when the post was made
