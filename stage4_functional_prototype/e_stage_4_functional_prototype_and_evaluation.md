# E. Functional Prototype and Evaluation

# Prototype



# E.X. User Evaluation

## User 3

### Sign up task

+ We are too ambiguous in the instructions we give to the user in:
	+ Money spent per week input
	+ Motivation input
	+ Times the addiction is practiced weekly input

### Chatting task

+ The *create group* and *add friends* icons need to be more specific
+ The colors for group chat distinction is a good measure

### Communities task

+ Maybe the community description could have an option to be hidden
+ Very intuitive layout
